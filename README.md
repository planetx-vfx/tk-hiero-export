# Shotgun Export <img src="icon_256.png" alt="Icon" height="24"/>

App that adds Shotgun awareness to Nuke Studio's sequence export.  It adds a new processor that will use the configuration to determine paths for Nuke scripts and plates.  It also will use the tags to determine Shotgun Shot status and task templates to create/update the Shots in Shotgun.

> Supported engines: tk-hiero, tk-nuke

| `default_task_filter`   | A filter that will return the task in the Shot that publishes will be registered against.  This value must be a valid filter that can be passed to the find method of the Shotgun api, without a condition for entity (a value linking entity to the Shot will be added at publish time).  If the filter contains a condition in the form ['step.Step.code', 'is', VALUE], then whatver VALUE is will be used by the default translate_template hook as the value to use when expanding {Step} in the publish templates.  If the filter results in a single task, then any publishes created by the app will be associated with that task.  Otherwise they will only be associated with the Shot. | [['step.Step.code', 'is', 'Comp']] |
